# Week 4

* Task 1_1: Optical Flow with Block Matching
* Task 1_2: Off-the-shelf Optical Flow
* Task 2_1: Video stabilization with Block Matching
* Task 2_2: Off-the-shelf stabilization
* Task 3: Object tracking with Optical Flow

## Execution
 
To execute each task, simply run with:

```bash
python task#.py -h
```

TODO: Each task has a different number of input arguments and it's executed from a different file. We must refactor it to have a single main function.

Note: Add AIcity folder into data/ to use it. Clone the following repos to use each algorithm:

+ [Pyflow](https://github.com/pathak22/pyflow)
+ [RAFT](https://github.com/oscar-lorente/RAFT)
+ [MaskFlownet](https://github.com/oscar-lorente/MaskFlownet)
+ [Mesh-Flow](https://github.com/sudheerachary/Mesh-Flow-Video-Stabilization)
+ [L1 Video stabilization](https://github.com/VAIBHAV-2303/VideoStabilization)
