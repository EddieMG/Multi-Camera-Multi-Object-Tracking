# Week 5

#### Task 1: Multi-target single camera tracking

* Applying the best method from last week on all the cameras from Sequence S03 of the AI City Challenge Track 3
* Report best results for each camera.

#### Task 2: Multi-target multi camera tracking

* Using Metric Learning to cluster ID's of different cameras.
* Developing a ReID algorithm for a cross camera tracking.

## Execution
 
To execute each task, simply run with:

```bash
python task#.py -h
```


Note: Add AIcity folder into data/ to use it. Clone the following repos to use each algorithm:
